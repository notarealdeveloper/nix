# private.nix
#
# the type system described in system.nix
# referred to certain types as "secret"
#
# the secrets in question
# can be further subdivided into two sub-types:
#
# a. real secrets
# b. serious secrets
#
# real secrets are the things you'd never
# put anywhere remote, no matter how secure
# that remote place claimed to be.
# real secrets are things like:
#
# 1. private keys to your local bitcoins,
# 2. any files detailing the highly illegal
#    activities you've been engaged in,
#    whether non-executable (~/terror.txt)
#    or executable (~/bin/laden).
# 3. naked pictures of your mom.
#    (not my mom. (i mean your mom.
#    (i mean i've got to keep them
#    (somewhere.))))
#
# serious secrets, on the other hand, are
# all the sooper serious bullshit secrets
# we're all required to keep track of these
# days as a punishment for being alive.
# because these secrets are s(u|oo)per srs,
# secrets of this type can and should be
# tossed around into any reasonably corporate
# sounding or somewhat trustworthy-ish remote
# storage service without losing sleep.
#
# it is these latter kind of less important
# secrets to which the term "secret" refers
# below. tl;dr: don't worry. your mom's
# pictures are safe.
